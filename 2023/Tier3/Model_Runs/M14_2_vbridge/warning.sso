Note 1 Suggestion: This model has just one settlement event. Changing to recr_dist_method 4 and removing the recruitment distribution parameters at the end of the MG parms section (below growth parameters) will produce identical results and simplify the model.
Warning 1 : Final gradient: 0.000104075 is larger than final_conv: 0.0001
Note 2 Information:  N parameters that are on or within 1% of min-max bound: 6; check results, variance may be suspect
