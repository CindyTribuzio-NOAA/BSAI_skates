Warning 1 : fishing fleet: 1 surveytime read as: 1 normally is -1 for fishing fleet; can override for indiv. obs. using 1000+month
Warning 2 : fishing fleet: 2 surveytime read as: 1 normally is -1 for fishing fleet; can override for indiv. obs. using 1000+month
Note 1 Suggestion: This model has just one settlement event. Changing to recr_dist_method 4 and removing the recruitment distribution parameters at the end of the MG parms section (below growth parameters) will produce identical results and simplify the model.
Warning 3 : Maximum pop size bin:_132; is within 5% of L at maxage for sex: 1; Gpat: 1 settle: 1; L= 211.403
Warning 4 : Final gradient: 1.2312e+13 is larger than final_conv: 0.0001
Note 2 Information: A revised protocol for the Fcast_yr specification is available and recommended.
Note 3 Information:  N parameters that are on or within 1% of min-max bound: 2; check results, variance may be suspect
